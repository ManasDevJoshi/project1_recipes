    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the filling:
        <p>Finely chop vegetables (e.g., cabbage, carrots, and onions).
        Cook minced meat (e.g., chicken or pork) with spices and seasonings.
        Mix the vegetables with the cooked meat or prepare a vegetarian filling with just the vegetables.
        </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Make the dough:
        <p>In a bowl, mix all-purpose flour, water, and a pinch of salt.
        Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.
        Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.
        </p>    
        </li>
        
        <li>Shape the momos:
        <p>Roll the dough into small, thin circles.
        Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle.
        Fold the dough over the filling and pleat the edges to seal the momo.
        </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Steam the momos:
        <p>Grease a steamer basket or line it with lettuce leaves.
        Arrange the momos in the steamer, leaving space between them.
        Steam the momos for about 10-15 minutes until cooked through.
        </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Serve and enjoy:
        <p>Transfer the steamed momos to a serving plate.
        Serve hot with a dipping sauce of your choice (e.g., soy sauce or tomato chutney).
        Enjoy the delicious momos!
